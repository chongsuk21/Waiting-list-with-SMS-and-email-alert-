# Waiting-list-with-SMS-and-email-alert-
Restaurant waiting list app

This app enables busy restaurant owners to store information of people who are in wait-list

User can register customers along with their contact information (First name, lastname, phone number, how many people, Email and Time)

When user register customers they will be stored according to the timestamp (So basically first come first serve)

User can also delete or update their information

User can text-alert customers, for example when you have an empty table you can text or send an email to your customers

The app uses EMail-SMS-gateway service API, so it uses email to send text message

Unfortunately my phone company Videotron does not support that service so I can only use Email-gateway service so when you do text alert, it will

only send an email. However, sending a text message is exactly the same mechanism.

Instructino to use the app

1. Run the app 

2. Register customers along with their contact informations

3. Update their informations if required

4. Text Alert if you have a table 

5. When the customers you did text-alert came, delete their record by pressing 'delete' button
